    - "Beginning with Android 5.0 (API level 21), the system throws an
        exception if you call bindService() with an implicit intent."

* From https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts
    - "If your app targets API level 26 or higher, you cannot use the
        manifest to declare a receiver for implicit broadcasts
        (broadcasts that do not target your app specifically), except
        for a few implicit broadcasts that are exempted from that
        restriction.
    - It lists a number of action values that are exempt but I could
        not get these actions to work with API version 35. I could
        get these to work with API version 24.

* From https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent
    - An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed.
        It can be used with `startActivity` to launch an `Activity`,
        `broadcastIntent` to send it to any interested `BroadcastReceiver`
        components, and `Context.startService(Intent)` or
        `Context.bindService(Intent, BindServiceFlags, Executor, ServiceConnection)`
        to communicate with a background Service.
    - An intent "is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract
        description of an action to be performed."
    - An explicit component can be specified in an intent
    - Two primary forms of intents
        * Explicit
            - Specify a particular component
            - "Often these will not include any other information,
                    simply being a way for an application to launch
                    various internal activities it has as the user
                    interacts with the application."
        * Implicit
            - No specified component
            - "When using implicit intents, given such an arbitrary intent
                    we need to know what to do with it. This is handled by
                    the process of Intent resolution, which maps an Intent
                    to an Activity, BroadcastReceiver, or Service
                    (or sometimes two or more activities/receivers)
                    that can handle it.
    - Components can be registered for intent handling by registering
            an `<intent-filter>` in the AndroidManifest.xml file
            or `BroadcastReceiver` objects can be registered dynamically
            with `Context#registerReceiver`
